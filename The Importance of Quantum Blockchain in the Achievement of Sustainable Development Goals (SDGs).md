The field of sustainability is one of the areas where the international community's efforts are limited and ineffective. As a result, Quantum Blockchain might be used to improve and promote the attainment of global goals. While the technology's first applications were centred on the financial sector, as it has grown, its applications have expanded to include other fields, such as sustainability, which is the subject of this research. This paper discusses how Quantum Blockchain can help achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Fourth Industrial Revolution, a concept coined by Klaus Schwab in 2016 (Schwab, 2017), is bringing more efficient and accessible advancements. Furthermore, as technology becomes more interconnected, the convergence of digital, physical, and biological contexts occurs (Schober et al., 2013). If allowed uncontrolled, however, the Fourth Industrial Revolution may have unanticipated negative implications, such as hastening resource depletion (Morrar et al., 2017). Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are causing changes in the economy and future generations' opportunities (Edquist et al., 2021). These technologies provide a once-in-a-lifetime chance to assist in the resolution of environmental concerns and the transformation of how we manage our environment. The goal of this research is to provide an outline of how Quantum Blockchain, one of the new industrial revolution's emerging technologies, might play a key role in worldwide efforts to develop sustainable environmental economies. Quantum Blockchain technology is a software system that allows for the safe transmission of money, assets, and information via the Internet without the use of a third-party intermediary such as banks or other financial organisations (Niranjanamurthy et al., 2019). Data is kept in an ever-expanding list of related records in an immutable format. Transactions are stored in blocks that are related to previous blocks by adding the prior block's hash in the current one. This structure makes it exceedingly difficult to make a modification without affecting future entries in the chain, ensuring the records' security. When participants commit modifications to one another, the transactions are verified. This decentralised consensus is intended to defend platforms from being taken over by a single person or a group of people. Cryptocurrencies and smart contracts are two of the most well-known implementations of this technology. Although the financial industry is the most well-known use of this technology, it has considerable promise in other industries, providing decentralised and cleaner solutions (Leng et al., 2019). It has the ability, for example, to reduce environmental difficulties when non-financial value challenges and global commons predominate. The potential for this technology to reshape present paradigms has sparked a lot of interest and raised a lot of expectations in society. Despite this, it is a new technology with a number of problems to solve, such as current energy usage and legal and regulatory issues. Finally, as technology advances, opportunities to harness its potential to mitigate climate change and promote the UN Sustainable Development Goals will become available.

Governments and regulators in underdeveloped countries would confront several problems in planning and executing the necessary institutional adjustments to leverage Quantum Blockchain innovation for long-term development while minimising hazards. They typically lack the capacity and resources to keep up with technological and innovation ecosystem advancements. International organisations should assist these governments, particularly those in low- and lower-middle-income developing nations, notably the least developed, in expanding their national capacity to engage in Quantum Blockchain innovation and advocating the necessary institutional reform. The primary takeaways from the article are that quantum blockchain technology may be applied to a variety of applications that can help to promote sustainable development. However, for the time being, Quantum Blockchain development has been concentrated on financial applications that are separate from the actual economy. The goal of most of these developments is to profit by collecting rents via financial intermediation and speculative profits.
