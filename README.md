# **Psi Chain**

Psi Chain is a decentralised, encrypted, and distributed database based on quantum information theory and quantum computing. The data will not be tampered with after it has been recorded on the quantum blockchain. The advancement of quantum computing and quantum information theory has led to an increase in the number of researchers focusing on quantum blockchain research in recent years. In this article, we examine recent breakthroughs in the realm of quantum blockchain and briefly discuss its benefits over traditional blockchain. The quantum blockchain's construction and structure are discussed. Then we'll go through how to apply quantum technology to a specific area of the larger blockchain.
